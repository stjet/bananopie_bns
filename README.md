A direct translation of the resolver bits of the [BNS Typescript Library](https://github.com/stjet/bns) into Python. That Typescript library relies on the banani library, which was a translation of bananopie (a Python library for Banano). And this library relies on bananopie too... Seems like I've gone full circle.

Published on pypi as [bananopie-bns](https://pypi.org/project/bananopie-bns/), but write `import bananopie_bns` in the actual code.

```
pip install bananopie-bns
```
