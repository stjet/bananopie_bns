A direct translation of the resolver bits of the [BNS Typescript Library](https://github.com/stjet/bns) into Python. That Typescript library relies on the banani library, which was a translation of bananopie (a Python library for Banano). And this library relies on bananopie too... Seems like I've gone full circle.
